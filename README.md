# TTGO ST7789 Driver for MicroPython #
This driver is based on [russhughes](https://github.com/russhughes/st7789_mpy) and [devbis](https://github.com/devbis/st7789_mpy) st7789_mpy driver. I modified the original driver for one of my projects to add:

- Text processing on the screen (display left, right, center up, down ...)
- Display of figures (square, rectangle, pentagon, circle, ellipse ... - filled and empty)
- on-screen **MENU** management
- **FTP** file transfer ([robert-hh](https://github.com/robert-hh/FTP-Server-for-ESP8266-ESP32-and-PYBD))
